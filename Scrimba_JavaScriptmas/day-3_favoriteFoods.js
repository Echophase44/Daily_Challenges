/* Challenge 1: Favorite Foods
- Topic: Object Destructuring

your favorite foods.
2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.

const faveFoods = {
  breakfast: 'cereal',
  lunch: 'sandwich',
  supper: 'stew'
}

const {breakfast, lunch, supper} = faveFoods

const meals = document.getElementById("meals");

meals.innerHTML = `<p>For breakfast, I like to have ${breakfast} with nuts. For lunch, I'll make myself a ${lunch} with some chips. When supper comes around, I'll get the ${supper} off the stove, which has been simmering all day.</p>`
